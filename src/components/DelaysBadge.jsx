// Amber "Delays" badge for delay-classified incidents — set by the producer as
// `status.type === 'delay'` (an official MARTA alert reporting delays, or a bot
// headway gap; see export-web.js and isDelayIncident). The MARTA analog of CTA's
// Metra "delayed" status badge. Presentational only: callers decide when to show
// it (additively, alongside the live "ongoing" pill / duration).
